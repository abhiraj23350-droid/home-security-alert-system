# 🏠 Home Security Alert System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple Home Security Alert System built using Arduino UNO and an Ultrasonic Sensor.  
The system detects nearby objects or intruders based on distance measurement.  

If someone comes within a specific distance range, a buzzer alarm is activated to alert the user.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic distance sensing and alert systems.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect intruders using distance measurement
- Trigger an alarm when someone comes close
- Build a simple and low-cost home security prototype

---

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The Ultrasonic Sensor sends out ultrasonic sound waves and waits for the echo to return.

1. The sensor continuously measures the distance.
2. If the detected distance is less than a predefined limit (e.g., 20 cm),
3. The Arduino activates the buzzer.
4. If no object is detected within range, the buzzer remains OFF.

This allows the system to detect intruders near doors, windows, or restricted areas.
